welcome to my site — it’s where i drop everything i’m building, cooking, and figuring out along the wayy

## about
i’m a student, aspiring chef, and someone who loves mixing creativity with tech.  
i’m building **ChefsCircle**, an ai-powered cooking platform, and experimenting with food content in between classes.

## here you’ll find
- random projects and experiments  
- food ideas that go from “this might work” to “okay that’s fire”  
- bits of design, writing, and whatever i’m learning next
